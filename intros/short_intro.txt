# Document redaction

Redact personally identifiable information (PII) from documents (pdf, png, jpg), Word files (docx), or tabular data (xlsx/csv/parquet). Please see the [User Guide]({USER_GUIDE_URL}) for a full walkthrough of all the features and settings.
    
To start, upload a document below (or click on an example), then click 'Extract text and redact document' to redact the document. Then, view and modify suggested redactions on the 'Review redactions' tab.

NOTE: The app is not 100% accurate, and it will miss some personal information. It is essential that all outputs are reviewed **by a human** before using the final outputs.
