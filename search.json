    "section": "Basic redaction",
    "text": "Basic redaction\nThe document redaction app can detect personally-identifiable information (PII) in documents. Documents can be redacted directly, or suggested redactions can be reviewed and modified using a grapical user interface. Basic document redaction can be performed quickly using the default options.\nDownload the example PDFs above to your computer. Open up the redaction app with the link provided by email.\n\n\n\nUpload files\n\n\n\nUpload files to the app\nThe ‘Redact PDFs/images tab’ currently accepts PDFs and image files (JPG, PNG) for redaction. Click on the ‘Drop files here or Click to Upload’ area of the screen, and select one of the three different example files (they should all be stored in the same folder if you want them to be redacted at the same time).\n\n\nText extraction\nYou can modify default text extraction methods by clicking on the ‘Change default text extraction method…’ box’.\nHere you can select one of the three text extraction options: - ‘Local model - selectable text’ - This will read text directly from PDFs that have selectable text to redact (using PikePDF). This is fine for most PDFs, but will find nothing if the PDF does not have selectable text, and it is not good for handwriting or signatures. If it encounters an image file, it will send it onto the second option below. - ‘Local OCR model - PDFs without selectable text’ - This option will use a simple Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model (Tesseract) to pull out text from a PDF/image that it ‘sees’. This can handle most typed text in PDFs/images without selectable text, but struggles with handwriting/signatures. If you are interested in the latter, then you should use the third option if available. - ‘AWS Textract service - all PDF types’ - Only available for instances of the app running on AWS. AWS Textract is a service that performs OCR on documents within their secure service. This is a more advanced version of OCR compared to the local option, and carries a (relatively small) cost. Textract excels in complex documents based on images, or documents that contain a lot of handwriting and signatures.\n\n\nEnable AWS Textract signature extraction\nIf you chose the AWS Textract service above, you can choose if you want handwriting and/or signatures redacted by default. Choosing signatures here will have a cost implication, as identifying signatures will cost ~£2.66 ($3.50) per 1,000 pages vs ~£1.14 ($1.50) per 1,000 pages without signature detection.\n\n\n\nAWS Textract handwriting and signature options\n\n\nNOTE: it is also possible to enable form extraction, layout extraction, and table extraction with AWS Textract. This is not enabled by default, but it is possible for your system admin to enable this feature in the config file.\n\n\nPII redaction method\nIf you are running with the AWS service enabled, here you will also have a choice for PII redaction method: - ‘Only extract text - (no redaction)’ - If you are only interested in getting the text out of the document for further processing (e.g. to find duplicate pages, or to review text on the Review redactions page) - ‘Local’ - This uses the spacy package to rapidly detect PII in extracted text. This method is often sufficient if you are just interested in redacting specific terms defined in a custom list. - ‘AWS Comprehend’ - This method calls an AWS service to provide more accurate identification of PII in extracted text.\n\n\nOptional - costs and time estimation\nIf the option is enabled (by your system admin, in the config file), you will see a cost and time estimate for the redaction process. ‘Existing Textract output file found’ will be checked automatically if previous Textract text extraction files exist in the output folder, or have been previously uploaded by the user (saving time and money for redaction).\n\n\n\nCost and time estimation\n\n\n\n\nOptional - cost code selection\nIf the option is enabled (by your system admin, in the config file), you may be prompted to select a cost code before continuing with the redaction task.\n\n\n\nCost code selection\n\n\nThe relevant cost code can be found either by: 1. Using the search bar above the data table to find relevant cost codes, then clicking on the relevant row, or 2. typing it directly into the dropdown to the right, where it should filter as you type.\n\n\nOptional - Submit whole documents to Textract API\nIf this option is enabled (by your system admin, in the config file), you will have the option to submit whole documents in quick succession to the AWS Textract service to get extracted text outputs quickly (faster than using the ‘Redact document’ process described here). This feature is described in more detail in the advanced user guide.\n\n\n\nTextract document API\n\n\n\n\nRedact the document\nClick ‘Redact document’. After loading in the document, the app should be able to process about 30 pages per minute (depending on redaction methods chose above). When ready, you should see a message saying that processing is complete, with output files appearing in the bottom right.\n\n\nRedaction outputs\n\n\n\nRedaction outputs\n\n\n\n‘…redacted.pdf’ files contain the original pdf with suggested redacted text deleted and replaced by a black box on top of the document.\n‘…redactions_for_review.pdf’ files contain the original PDF with redaction boxes overlaid but the original text still visible underneath. This file is designed for use in Adobe Acrobat and other PDF viewers where you can see the suggested redactions without the text being permanently removed. This is particularly useful for reviewing redactions before finalising them.\n‘…ocr_results.csv’ files contain the line-by-line text outputs from the entire document. This file can be useful for later searching through for any terms of interest in the document (e.g. using Excel or a similar program).\n‘…review_file.csv’ files are the review files that contain details and locations of all of the suggested redactions in the document. This file is key to the review process, and should be downloaded to use later for this.\n\n\n\nAdditional AWS Textract / local OCR outputs\nIf you have used the AWS Textract option for extracting text, you may also see a ’…_textract.json’ file. This file contains all the relevant extracted text information that comes from the AWS Textract service. You can keep this file and upload it at a later date alongside your input document, which will enable you to skip calling AWS Textract every single time you want to do a redaction task, as follows:\n\n\n\nDocument upload alongside Textract\n\n\nSimilarly, if you have used the ‘Local OCR method’ to extract text, you may see a ’…_ocr_results_with_words.json’ file. This file works in the same way as the AWS Textract .json results described above, and can be uploaded alongside an input document to save time on text extraction in future in the same way.\n\n\nDownloading output files from previous redaction tasks\nIf you are logged in via AWS Cognito and you lose your app page for some reason (e.g. from a crash, reloading), it is possible recover your previous output files, provided the server has not been shut down since you redacted the document. Go to ‘Redaction settings’, then scroll to the bottom to see ‘View all output files from this session’.\n\n\n\nView all output files\n\n\n\n\nBasic redaction summary\nWe have covered redacting documents with the default redaction options. The ‘…redacted.pdf’ file output may be enough for your purposes. But it is very likely that you will need to customise your redaction options, which we will cover below."

    "section": "Customising redaction options",
    "text": "Customising redaction options\nOn the ‘Redaction settings’ page, there are a number of options that you can tweak to better match your use case and needs.\n\nCustom allow, deny, and page redaction lists\nThe app allows you to specify terms that should never be redacted (an allow list), terms that should always be redacted (a deny list), and also to provide a list of page numbers for pages that should be fully redacted.\n\n\n\nCustom allow, deny, and page redaction lists\n\n\n\nAllow list example\nIt may be the case that specific terms that are frequently redacted are not interesting to\nIn the redacted outputs of the ‘Example of files sent to a professor before applying’ PDF, you can see that it is frequently redacting references to Dr Hyde’s lab in the main body of the text. Let’s say that references to Dr Hyde were not considered personal information in this context. You can exclude this term from redaction (and others) by providing an ‘allow list’ file. This is simply a csv that contains the case sensitive terms to exclude in the first column, in our example, ‘Hyde’ and ‘Muller glia’. The example file is provided here.\nTo import this to use with your redaction tasks, go to the ‘Redaction settings’ tab, click on the ‘Import allow list file’ button halfway down, and select the csv file you have created. It should be loaded for next time you hit the redact button. Go back to the first tab and do this.\n\n\nDeny list example\nSay you wanted to remove specific terms from a document. In this app you can do this by providing a custom deny list as a csv. Like for the allow list described above, this should be a one-column csv without a column header. The app will suggest each individual term in the list with exact spelling as whole words. So it won’t select text from within words. To enable this feature, the ‘CUSTOM’ tag needs to be chosen as a redaction entity (the process for adding/removing entity types to redact is described below).\nHere is an example using the Partnership Agreement Toolkit file. This is an example of a custom deny list file. ‘Sister’, ‘Sister City’ ‘Sister Cities’, ‘Friendship City’ have been listed as specific terms to redact. You can see the outputs of this redaction process on the review page:\n.\nYou can see that the app has highlighted all instances of these terms on the page shown. You can then consider each of these terms for modification or removal on the review page explained here.\n\n\nFull page redaction list example\nThere may be full pages in a document that you want to redact. The app also provides the capability of redacting pages completely based on a list of input page numbers in a csv. The format of the input file is the same as that for the allow and deny lists described above - a one-column csv without a column header. An example of this is here. You can see an example of the redacted page on the review page:\n.\nUsing the above approaches to allow, deny, and full page redaction lists will give you an output like this.\n\n\nAdding to the loaded allow, deny, and whole page lists in-app\nIf you open the accordion below the allow list options called ‘Manually modify custom allow…’, you should be able to see a few tables with options to add new rows:\n\n\n\nManually modify allow or deny list\n\n\nIf the table is empty, you can add a new entry, you can add a new row by clicking on the ‘+’ item below each table header. If there is existing data, you may need to click on the three dots to the right and select ‘Add row below’. Type the item you wish to keep/remove in the cell, and then (important) press enter to add this new item to the allow/deny/whole page list. Your output tables should look something like below.\n\n\n\nManually modify allow or deny list filled\n\n\n\n\n\nRedacting additional types of personal information\nYou may want to redact additional types of information beyond the defaults, or you may not be interested in default suggested entity types. There are dates in the example complaint letter. Say we wanted to redact those dates also?\nUnder the ‘Redaction settings’ tab, go to ‘Entities to redact (click close to down arrow for full list)’. Different dropdowns are provided according to whether you are using the Local service to redact PII, or the AWS Comprehend service. Click within the empty box close to the dropdown arrow and you should see a list of possible ‘entities’ to redact. Select ‘DATE_TIME’ and it should appear in the main list. To remove items, click on the ‘x’ next to their name.\n\n\n\nRedacting additional types of information dropdown\n\n\nNow, go back to the main screen and click ‘Redact Document’ again. You should now get a redacted version of ‘Example complaint letter’ that has the dates and times removed.\nIf you want to redact different files, I suggest you refresh your browser page to start a new session and unload all previous data."

    "text": "Reviewing and modifying suggested redactions\nSometimes the app will suggest redactions that are incorrect, or will miss personal information entirely. The app allows you to review and modify suggested redactions to compensate for this. You can do this on the ‘Review redactions’ tab.\nWe will go through ways to review suggested redactions with an example.On the first tab ‘PDFs/images’ upload the ‘Example of files sent to a professor before applying.pdf’ file. Let’s stick with the ‘Local model - selectable text’ option, and click ‘Redact document’. Once the outputs are created, go to the ‘Review redactions’ tab.\nOn the ‘Review redactions’ tab you have a visual interface that allows you to inspect and modify redactions suggested by the app. There are quite a few options to look at, so we’ll go from top to bottom.\n\n\n\nReview redactions\n\n\n\nUploading documents for review\nThe top area has a file upload area where you can upload files for review . In the left box, upload the original PDF file. Click ‘1. Upload original PDF’. In the right box, you can upload the ’…_review_file.csv’ that is produced by the redaction process.\nOptionally, you can upload a ’…_ocr_result_with_words’ file here, that will allow you to search through the text and easily add new redactions based on word search. You can also upload one of the ’…_ocr_output.csv’ file here that comes out of a redaction task, so that you can navigate the extracted text from the document. Click the button ‘2. Upload Review or OCR csv files’ load in these files.\nNow you can review and modify the suggested redactions using the interface described below.\n\n\n\nSearch extracted text\n\n\nYou can upload the three review files in the box (unredacted document, ’…_review_file.csv’ and ’…_ocr_output.csv’ file) before clicking ‘Review redactions based on original PDF…’, as in the image below:\n\n\n\nUpload three files for review\n\n\nNOTE: ensure you upload the unredacted document here and not the redacted version, otherwise you will be checking over a document that already has redaction boxes applied!\n\n\nPage navigation\nYou can change the page viewed either by clicking ‘Previous page’ or ‘Next page’, or by typing a specific page number in the ‘Current page’ box and pressing Enter on your keyboard. Each time you switch page, it will save redactions you have made on the page you are moving from, so you will not lose changes you have made.\nYou can also navigate to different pages by clicking on rows in the tables under ‘Search suggested redactions’ to the right, or ‘search all extracted text’ (if enabled) beneath that.\n\n\nThe document viewer pane\nOn the selected page, each redaction is highlighted with a box next to its suggested redaction label (e.g. person, email).\n\n\n\nDocument view pane\n\n\nThere are a number of different options to add and modify redaction boxes and page on the document viewer pane. To zoom in and out of the page, use your mouse wheel. To move around the page while zoomed, you need to be in modify mode. Scroll to the bottom of the document viewer to see the relevant controls. You should see a box icon, a hand icon, and two arrows pointing counter-clockwise and clockwise.\n\n\n\nChange redaction mode\n\n\nClick on the hand icon to go into modify mode. When you click and hold on the document viewer, This will allow you to move around the page when zoomed in. To rotate the page, you can click on either of the round arrow buttons to turn in that direction.\nNOTE: When you switch page, the viewer will stay in your selected orientation, so if it looks strange, just rotate the page again and hopefully it will look correct!\n\nModify existing redactions (hand icon)\nAfter clicking on the hand icon, the interface allows you to modify existing redaction boxes. When in this mode, you can click and hold on an existing box to move it.\n\n\n\nModify existing redaction box\n\n\nClick on one of the small boxes at the edges to change the size of the box. To delete a box, click on it to highlight it, then press delete on your keyboard. Alternatively, double click on a box and click ‘Remove’ on the box that appears.\n\n\n\nRemove existing redaction box\n\n\n\n\nAdd new redaction boxes (box icon)\nTo change to ‘add redaction boxes’ mode, scroll to the bottom of the page. Click on the box icon, and your cursor will change into a crosshair. Now you can add new redaction boxes where you wish. A popup will appear when you create a new box so you can select a label and colour for the new box.\n\n\n‘Locking in’ new redaction box format\nIt is possible to lock in a chosen format for new redaction boxes so that you don’t have the popup appearing each time. When you make a new box, select the options for your ‘locked’ format, and then click on the lock icon on the left side of the popup, which should turn blue.\n\n\n\nLock redaction box format\n\n\nYou can now add new redaction boxes without a popup appearing. If you want to change or ‘unlock’ the your chosen box format, you can click on the new icon that has appeared at the bottom of the document viewer pane that looks a little like a gift tag. You can then change the defaults, or click on the lock icon again to ‘unlock’ the new box format - then popups will appear again each time you create a new box.\n\n\n\nChange or unlock redaction box format\n\n\n\n\n\nApply redactions to PDF and Save changes on current page\nOnce you have reviewed all the redactions in your document and you are happy with the outputs, you can click ‘Apply revised redactions to PDF’ to create a new ’_redacted.pdf’ output alongside a new ’_review_file.csv’ output.\nIf you are working on a page and haven’t saved for a while, you can click ‘Save changes on current page to file’ to ensure that they are saved to an updated ‘review_file.csv’ output.\n\n\n\nReview modified outputs\n\n\n\n\nSelecting and removing redaction boxes using the ‘Search suggested redactions’ table\nThe table shows a list of all the suggested redactions in the document alongside the page, label, and text (if available).\n\n\n\nSearch suggested redaction area\n\n\nIf you click on one of the rows in this table, you will be taken to the page of the redaction. Clicking on a redaction row on the same page will change the colour of redaction box to blue to help you locate it in the document viewer (just when using the app, not in redacted output PDFs).\n\n\n\nSearch suggested redaction area\n\n\nYou can choose a specific entity type to see which pages the entity is present on. If you want to go to the page specified in the table, you can click on a cell in the table and the review page will be changed to that page.\nTo filter the ‘Search suggested redactions’ table you can: 1. Click on one of the dropdowns (Redaction category, Page, Text), and select an option, or 2. Write text in the ‘Filter’ box just above the table. Click the blue box to apply the filter to the table.\nOnce you have filtered the table, or selected a row from the table, you have a few options underneath on what you can do with the filtered rows:\n\nClick the Exclude all redactions in table button to remove all redactions visible in the table from the document. Important: ensure that you have clicked the blue tick icon next to the search box before doing this, or you will remove all redactions from the document. If you do end up doing this, click the ‘Undo last element removal’ button below to restore the redactions.\nClick the Exclude specific redaction row button to remove only the redaction from the last row you clicked on from the document. The currently selected row is visible below.\nClick the Exclude all redactions with the same text as selected row button to remove all redactions from the document that are exactly the same as the selected row text.\n\nNOTE: After excluding redactions using any of the above options, click the ‘Reset filters’ button below to ensure that the dropdowns and table return to seeing all remaining redactions in the document.\nIf you made a mistake, click the ‘Undo last element removal’ button to restore the Search suggested redactions table to its previous state (can only undo the last action).\n\n\nSearching and Adding Custom Redactions\nAfter a document has been processed, you may need to redact specific terms, names, or phrases that the automatic PII (Personally Identifiable Information) detection might have missed. The “Search text to make new redactions” tab gives you the power to find and redact any text within your document manually.\n\nHow to Use the Search and Redact Feature\nThe workflow is designed to be simple: Search → Select → Redact.\n\n\n\nStep 1: Search for Text\n\nNavigate to the “Search text to make new redactions” tab.\nThe main table will initially be populated with all the text extracted from the document, broken down by word.\nTo narrow this down, use the “Multi-word text search” box to type the word or phrase you want to find.\nClick the “Search” button or press Enter.\nThe table below will update to show only the rows containing text that matches your search query.\n\n\nTip: You can also filter the results by page number using the “Page” dropdown. To clear all filters and see the full text again, click the “Reset table to original state” button.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Select and Review a Match\nWhen you click on any row in the search results table:\n\nThe document preview on the left will automatically jump to that page, allowing you to see the word in its original context.\nThe details of your selection will appear in the smaller “Selected row” table for confirmation.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Choose Your Redaction Method\nYou have several powerful options for redacting the text you’ve found:\n\nRedact a Single, Specific Instance:\n\nClick on the exact row in the table you want to redact.\nClick the Redact specific text row button.\nOnly that single instance will be redacted.\n\nRedact All Instances of a Word/Phrase:\n\nLet’s say you want to redact the project name “Project Alpha” everywhere it appears.\nFind and select one instance of “Project Alpha” in the table.\nClick the Redact all words with same text as selected row button.\nThe application will find and redact every single occurrence of “Project Alpha” throughout the entire document.\n\nRedact All Current Search Results:\n\nPerform a search (e.g., for a specific person’s name).\nIf you are confident that every result shown in the filtered table should be redacted, click the Redact all text in table button.\nThis will apply a redaction to all currently visible items in the table in one go.\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomising Your New Redactions\nBefore you click one of the redact buttons, you can customize the appearance and label of the new redactions under the “Search options” accordion:\n\nLabel for new redactions: Change the text that appears on the redaction box (default is “Redaction”). You could change this to “CONFIDENTIAL” or “CUSTOM”.\nColour for labels: Set a custom color for the redaction box by providing an RGB value. The format must be three numbers (0-255) in parentheses, for example:\n\n(255, 0, 0) for Red\n(0, 0, 0) for Black\n(255, 255, 0) for Yellow\n\n\n\n\nUndoing a Mistake\nIf you make a mistake, you can reverse the last redaction action you performed on this tab.\n\nClick the Undo latest redaction button.

    "text": "Redacting Word, tabular data files (XLSX/CSV) or copy and pasted text\n\nWord or tabular data files (XLSX/CSV)\nThe app can be used to redact Word (.docx), or tabular data files such as xlsx or csv files. For this to work properly, your data file needs to be in a simple table format, with a single table starting from the first cell (A1), and no other information in the sheet. Similarly for .xlsx files, each sheet in the file that you want to redact should be in this simple format.\nTo demonstrate this, we can use the example csv file ‘combined_case_notes.csv’, which is a small dataset of dummy social care case notes. Go to the ‘Open text or Excel/csv files’ tab. Drop the file into the upload area. After the file is loaded, you should see the suggested columns for redaction in the box underneath. You can select and deselect columns to redact as you wish from this list.\n\n\n\ncsv upload\n\n\nIf you were instead to upload an xlsx file, you would see also a list of all the sheets in the xlsx file that can be redacted. The ‘Select columns’ area underneath will suggest a list of all columns in the file across all sheets.\n\n\n\nxlsx upload\n\n\nOnce you have chosen your input file and sheets/columns to redact, you can choose the redaction method. ‘Local’ will use the same local model as used for documents on the first tab. ‘AWS Comprehend’ will give better results, at a slight cost.\nWhen you click Redact text/data files, you will see the progress of the redaction task by file and sheet, and you will receive a csv output with the redacted data.\n\n\nChoosing output anonymisation format\nYou can also choose the anonymisation format of your output results. Open the tab ‘Anonymisation output format’ to see the options. By default, any detected PII will be replaced with the word ‘REDACTED’ in the cell. You can choose one of the following options as the form of replacement for the redacted text: - replace with ‘REDACTED’: Replaced by the word ‘REDACTED’ (default) - replace with : Replaced by e.g. ‘PERSON’ for people, ‘EMAIL_ADDRESS’ for emails etc. - redact completely: Text is removed completely and replaced by nothing. - hash: Replaced by a unique long ID code that is consistent with entity text. I.e. a particular name will always have the same ID code. - mask: Replace with stars ’*’.\n\n\nRedacting copy and pasted text\nYou can also write open text into an input box and redact that using the same methods as described above. To do this, write or paste text into the ‘Enter open text’ box that appears when you open the ‘Redact open text’ tab. Then select a redaction method, and an anonymisation output format as described above. The redacted text will be printed in the output textbox, and will also be saved to a simple csv file in the output file box.\n\n\n\nText analysis output\n\n\n\n\nRedaction log outputs\nA list of the suggested redaction outputs from the tabular data / open text data redaction is available on the Redaction settings page under ‘Log file outputs’."

    "section": "Identifying and redacting duplicate pages",
    "text": "Identifying and redacting duplicate pages\nThe files for this section are stored here.\nSome redaction tasks involve removing duplicate pages of text that may exist across multiple documents. This feature helps you find and remove duplicate content that may exist in single or multiple documents. It can identify everything from single identical pages to multi-page sections (subdocuments). The process involves three main steps: configuring the analysis, reviewing the results in the interactive interface, and then using the generated files to perform the redactions.\n\nDuplicate page detection in documents\nThis section covers finding duplicate pages across PDF documents using OCR output files.\n\n\n\nExample duplicate page inputs\n\n\nStep 1: Upload and Configure the Analysis First, navigate to the “Identify duplicate pages” tab. Upload all the ocr_output.csv files you wish to compare into the file area. These files are generated every time you run a redaction task and contain the text for each page of a document.\nFor our example, you can upload the four ‘ocr_output.csv’ files provided in the example folder into the file area. Click ‘Identify duplicate pages’ and you will see a number of files returned. In case you want to see the original PDFs, they are available here.\nThe default options will search for matching subdocuments of any length. Before running the analysis, you can configure these matching parameters to tell the tool what you’re looking for:\n\n\n\nDuplicate matching parameters\n\n\nMatching Parameters - Similarity Threshold: A score from 0 to 1. Pages or sequences of pages with a calculated text similarity above this value will be considered a match. The default of 0.9 (90%) is a good starting point for finding near-identical pages. - Min Word Count: Pages with fewer words than this value will be completely ignored during the comparison. This is extremely useful for filtering out blank pages, title pages, or boilerplate pages that might otherwise create noise in the results. The default is 10. - Choosing a Matching Strategy: You have three main options to find duplicate content. - ‘Subdocument’ matching (default): Use this to find the longest possible sequence of matching pages. The tool will find an initial match and then automatically expand it forward page-by-page until the consecutive match breaks. This is the best method for identifying complete copied chapters or sections of unknown length. This is enabled by default by ticking the “Enable ‘subdocument’ matching” box. This setting overrides the described below. - Minimum length subdocument matching: Use this to find sequences of consecutively matching pages with a minimum page lenght. For example, setting the slider to 3 will only return sections that are at least 3 pages long. How to enable: Untick the “Enable ‘subdocument’ matching” box and set the “Minimum consecutive pages” slider to a value greater than 1. - Single Page Matching: Use this to find all individual page pairs that are similar to each other. Leave the “Enable ‘subdocument’ matching” box unchecked and keep the “Minimum consecutive pages” slider at 1.\nOnce your parameters are set, click the “Identify duplicate pages/subdocuments” button.\nStep 2: Review Results in the Interface After the analysis is complete, the results will be displayed directly in the interface.\nAnalysis Summary: A table will appear showing a summary of all the matches found. The columns will change depending on the matching strategy you chose. For subdocument matches, it will show the start and end pages of the matched sequence.\nInteractive Preview: This is the most important part of the review process. Click on any row in the summary table. The full text of the matching page(s) will appear side-by-side in the “Full Text Preview” section below, allowing you to instantly verify the accuracy of the match.\n\n\n\nDuplicate review interface\n\n\nStep 3: Download and Use the Output Files The analysis also generates a set of downloadable files for your records and for performing redactions.\n\npage_similarity_results.csv: This is a detailed report of the analysis you just ran. It shows a breakdown of the pages from each file that are most similar to each other above the similarity threshold. You can compare the text in the two columns ‘Page_1_Text’ and ‘Page_2_Text’. For single-page matches, it will list each pair of matching pages. For subdocument matches, it will list the start and end pages of each matched sequence, along with the total length of the match.\n\n\n\n\nPage similarity file example\n\n\n\n[Original_Filename]_pages_to_redact.csv: For each input document that was found to contain duplicate content, a separate redaction list is created. This is a simple, one-column CSV file containing a list of all page numbers that should be removed. To use these files, you can either upload the original document (i.e. the PDF) on the ‘Review redactions’ tab, and then click on the ‘Apply relevant duplicate page output to document currently under review’ button. You should see the whole pages suggested for redaction on the ‘Review redactions’ tab. Alternatively, you can reupload the file into the whole page redaction section as described in the ‘Full page redaction list example’ section.\n\n\n\n\nExample duplicate page redaction list\n\n\nIf you want to combine the results from this redaction process with previous redaction tasks for the same PDF, you could merge review file outputs following the steps described in Merging existing redaction review files above.\n\n\nDuplicate detection in tabular data\nThe app also includes functionality to find duplicate cells or rows in CSV, Excel, or Parquet files. This is particularly useful for cleaning datasets where you need to identify and remove duplicate entries.\nStep 1: Upload files and configure analysis\nNavigate to the ‘Word or Excel/csv files’ tab and scroll down to the “Find duplicate cells in tabular data” section. Upload your tabular files (CSV, Excel, or Parquet) and configure the analysis parameters:\n\nSimilarity threshold: Score (0-1) to consider cells a match. 1 = perfect match\nMinimum word count: Cells with fewer words than this value are ignored\nDo initial clean of text: Remove URLs, HTML tags, and non-ASCII characters\nRemove duplicate rows: Automatically remove duplicate rows from deduplicated files\nSelect Excel sheet names: Choose which sheets to analyze (for Excel files)\nSelect text columns: Choose which columns contain text to analyze\n\nStep 2: Review results\nAfter clicking “Find duplicate cells/rows”, the results will be displayed in a table showing: - File1, Row1, File2, Row2 - Similarity_Score - Text1, Text2 (the actual text content being compared)\nClick on any row to see more details about the duplicate match in the preview boxes below.\nStep 3: Remove duplicates\nSelect a file from the dropdown and click “Remove duplicate rows from selected file” to create a cleaned version with duplicates removed. The cleaned file will be available for download."

Right click on the row number and select delete on this menu. Next, let’s imagine that what the app identified as a ‘phone number’ was in fact another type of number and so we wanted to change the label. Simply click on the relevant label cells, let’s change it to ‘SECURITY_NUMBER’. You could also use ‘Find & Select’ -&gt; ‘Replace’ from the top ribbon menu if you wanted to change a number of labels simultaneously.\nHow about we wanted to change the colour of the ‘email address’ entry on the redaction review tab of the redaction app? The colours in a review file are based on an RGB scale with three numbers ranging from 0-255. You can find suitable colours here. Using this scale, if I wanted my review box to be pure blue, I can change the cell value to (0,0,255).\nImagine that a redaction box was slightly too small, and I didn’t want to use the in-app options to change the size. In the review file csv, we can modify e.g. the ymin and ymax values for any box to increase the extent of the redaction box.

The env file should look like the following with just two lines:\nAWS_ACCESS_KEY= your-access-key AWS_SECRET_KEY= your-secret-key\nThe app should then pick up these keys when trying to access the AWS Textract and Comprehend services during redaction.\nAgain, a lot can potentially go wrong with AWS solutions that are insecure, so before trying the above please consult with your AWS and data security teams."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This guide gives an overview of how to install the app in an AWS environment using the code in the ‘cdk/’ folder of this Github repo. The most important thing you need is some familiarity with AWS and how to use it via console or command line, as well as administrator access to at least one region. Then follow the below steps.\n\n\n\nEnsure you have an AWS Administrator account in your desired region to be able to deploy all the resources mentioned in cdk_stack.py.\nInstall git on your computer from: https://git-scm.com\nInstall nodejs and npm: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm. If using Windows, it may be easiest to install from the .msi installer at the bottom of the page here.\nInstall AWS CDK v2: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html\nBootstrap the environment with CDK in both your primary region, and us-east-1 if installing CloudFront and associated WAF.\n# Bootstrap your primary region\ncdk bootstrap aws://&lt;YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT&gt;/eu-west-1\n\n# Bootstrap the us-east-1 region\ncdk bootstrap aws://&lt;YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT&gt;/us-east-1\nIn command line, write: bash     git clone https://github.com/seanpedrick-case/doc_redaction.git\n\n\n\n\nTo get full HTTPS data transfer through the app, you will need an SSL certificate registered with AWS Certificate Manager.\nYou can either use the SSL certificate from a domain, or import an existing certificate into Certificate Manager. If you’re not sure, ask your IT admin if you need help with this. If getting an SSL certificate for an existing domain, make sure to point the certificate to *.&lt;domain-name&gt;.\nUpdate your DNS records to include the CNAME record given by AWS. After your stack has been created, you will also need to create a CNAME DNS record for your domain pointing to your load balancer DNS with a subdomain, e.g., redaction.&lt;domain-name&gt;.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou need a cdk.json in the cdk folder. It should contain the following:\n{\n    \"app\": \"&lt;PATH TO PYTHON ENVIRONMENT FOLDER WHERE REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN LOADED&gt;/python.exe app.py\",\n    \"context\": {\n        \"@aws-cdk/aws-apigateway:usagePlanKeyOrderInsensitiveId\": true,\n        \"@aws-cdk/core:stackRelativeExports\": true,\n        \"@aws-cdk/aws-rds:lowercaseDbIdentifier\": true,\n        \"@aws-cdk/aws-lambda:recognizeVersionProps\": true,\n        \"@aws-cdk/aws-lambda:recognizeLayerVersion\": true,\n        \"@aws-cdk/aws-cloudfront:defaultSecurityPolicyTLSv1.2_2021\": true,\n        \"@aws-cdk/aws-ecs:arnFormatIncludesClusterName\": true,\n        \"@aws-cdk/core:newStyleStackSynthesis\": true,\n        \"aws-cdk:enableDiffNoFail\": true,\n        \"@aws-cdk/aws-ec2:restrictDefaultSecurityGroup\": true,\n        \"@aws-cdk/aws-apigateway:disableCloudWatchRole\": true,\n        \"@aws-cdk/core:target-partitions\": [\n        \"aws\",\n        \"aws-cn\"\n        ]\n    }\n    }\n\n\n\nDepending on which environment variables you put in this file, you can choose whether to install the app in a completely new VPC, or in an existing VPC. The following shows you example config files that you could use.\n\n\nHere as a minimum it would be useful to put the following details in the cdk_config.env file (below are all example values, other possible variables to use here can be seen in the cdk folder/cdk_config.py).\nCDK_PREFIX=example-prefix # This prefix will be added to the name of most of the created elements in your stack\nNEW_VPC_CIDR=10.0.0.0/24 # The CIDR range for your newly created VPC\nAWS_REGION=&lt;your-region&gt; # Region where elements will be created\nAWS_ACCOUNT_ID=1234567890 # AWS account ID that has administrator access that you will use for deploying the stack\nCDK_FOLDER=C:/path_to_cdk_folder/ # The place where the cdk folder code is located\nCONTEXT_FILE=C:/path_to_cdk_folder/cdk.context.json\nCOGNITO_USER_POOL_DOMAIN_PREFIX=redaction-12345 # The prefix of the login / user sign up domain that you want to use with Cognito login. Should not contain the terms amazon, aws, or cognito.\nCOGNITO_AUTH=0 # Do you want to do in-app authentication (username and password only, not necessary if you are using an SSL certificate as recommended below)  \nUSE_CLOUDFRONT=True # Recommended. If you intend to use CloudFront as the front URL to your application load balancer (ALB). This has some extra security features that you won't get with just an ALB, e.g. limiting app access by country.\nRUN_USEAST_STACK=False # Set this to True only if you have permissions to create a Cloudfront distribution and web ACL on top of it in the us-east-1 region. If you don't, the section below shows how you can create the CloudFront resource manually and map it to your application load balancer (as you should have permissions for that if you are admin in your region).\nCLOUDFRONT_DOMAIN=&lt;example&gt;.cloudfront.net # If you already know the domain of the CloudFront distribution that you want to use, you can add this here.\n# If you are using an SSL certificate with your ALB (highly recommended):\nACM_SSL_CERTIFICATE_ARN=&lt;SSL Certificate ARN&gt; # This is the ARN of the SSL certificate that you have installed in AWS Certificate Manager\nSSL_CERTIFICATE_DOMAIN=redaction.example.com # This is the domain of the SSL certificate that you have installed in AWS Certificate Manager\nNote: If you are using an SSL certificate with Cognito login on the application load balancer (strongly advised), you can set COGNITO_AUTH to 0 above, as you don’t need the second login step to get to the app\n\n\n\nFrom the above example, remove the variable ‘NEW_VPC_CIDR’ and replace with the below:\nVPC_NAME=example-vpc-name # Name of the VPC within which all the other elements will be created\nEXISTING_IGW_ID=igw-1234567890 # (optional) The ID for an existing internet gateway that you want to use instead of creating a new one\nSINGLE_NAT_GATEWAY_ID=nat-123456789 # (optional) The ID for an existing NAT gateway that you want to use instead of creating a new one\n\n\nIf you are using an existing VPC then you may want to deploy the app within existing subnets rather than creating new ones:\n\nIf you define no subnets in environment variables, the app will try to use existing private and public subnets. Bear in mind the app may overlap with IP addresses assigned to existing AWS resources. It is advised to at least specify existing subnets that you know are available, or create your own using one of the below methods.\nIf you want to use existing subnets, you can list them in the following environment variables:\n\nPUBLIC_SUBNETS_TO_USE=[\"PublicSubnet1\", \"PublicSubnet2\", \"PublicSubnet3\"]`\nPRIVATE_SUBNETS_TO_USE=[\"PrivateSubnet1\", \"PrivateSubnet2\", \"PrivateSubnet3\"]`\n\nIf you want to create new subnets, you need to also specify CIDR blocks and availability zones for the new subnets. The app will check with you upon deployment whether these CIDR blocks are available before trying to create.\n\nPUBLIC_SUBNET_CIDR_BLOCKS=['10.222.333.0/28', '10.222.333.16/28', '10.222.333.32/28']\nPUBLIC_SUBNET_AVAILABILITY_ZONES=['eu-east-1a', 'eu-east-1b', 'eu-east-1c']\nPRIVATE_SUBNET_CIDR_BLOCKS=['10.222.333.48/28', '10.222.333.64/28', '10.222.333.80/28']\nPRIVATE_SUBNET_AVAILABILITY_ZONES=['eu-east-1a', 'eu-east-1b', 'eu-east-1c']\nIf you try to create subnets in invalid CIDR blocks / availability zones, the console output will tell you and it will show you the currently occupied CIDR blocks to help find a space for new subnets you want to create.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn command line in console, go to your cdk folder in the redaction app folder. Run cdk deploy --all. This should try to deploy the first stack in the app.py file.\nHopefully everything will deploy successfully and you will be able to see your new stack in CloudFormation in the AWS console.\n\n\n\nThe CDK deployment will create all the AWS resources needed to run the redaction app. However, there are some objects in AWS\n\n\nThe following tasks are done by the post_cdk_build_quickstart.py file that you can find in the cdk folder. You will need to run this when logged in with AWS SSO through command line. I will describe how to do this in AWS console just in case the .py file doesn’t work for you.\n\n\nYou need to build CodeBuild project after stack has finished deploying your CDK stack, as there will be no container in ECR.\nIf you don’t want to run the ‘post_cdk_build_quickstart.py’ file, in console, go to CodeBuild -&gt; your project -&gt; click Start build. Check the logs, the build should complete in about 6-7 minutes.\n\n\n\nThe ‘post_cdk_build_quickstart’ file will upload a config file to S3, as the Fargate task definition references a config.env file.\nif you want to do this manually:\nCreate a config.env file to upload to the S3 bucket that has at least the following variables:\nCOGNITO_AUTH=0 # If you are using an SSL certificate with your application load balancer, you will be logging in there. Set this to 0 to turn off the default login screen.\nRUN_AWS_FUNCTIONS=1 # This will enable the app to communicate with AWS services.\nSESSION_OUTPUT_FOLDER=True # This will put outputs for each user in separate output folders.\n\nThen, go to S3 and choose the new ...-logs bucket that you created. Upload the config.env file into this bucket.\n\n\n\n\nNow that the app container is in Elastic Container Registry, you can proceed to run the app on a Fargate server. The ‘post_cdk_build_quickstart.py’ file will do this for you, but you can also try this in Console. In ECS, go to your new cluster, your new service, and select ‘Update service’.\nSelect ‘Force new deployment’, and then set ‘Desired number of tasks’ to 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the SSL certificate you are using is associated with a domain, you will need to update the DNS records for your domain registered with the AWS SSL certificate. To do this, you need to create a CNAME DNS record for your domain pointing to your load balancer DNS from a subdomain of your main domain registration, e.g., redaction.&lt;domain-name&gt;.\n\n\n\nYou will next need to a create a user in Cognito to be able to log into the app.\n\nGo to Cognito and create a user with your own email address. Generate a password.\nGo to Cognito -&gt; App clients -&gt; Login pages -&gt; View login page.\nEnter the email and temporary password details that come in the email (don’t include the last full stop!).\nChange your password on the screen that pops up. You should now be able to login to the app.\n\n\n\n\nOn the Cognito user pool page you can also enable MFA, if you are using an SSL certificate with Cognito login on the Application Load Balancer. Go to Cognito -&gt; your user pool -&gt; Sign in -&gt; Multi-factor authentication.\n\n\n\nNote: this is only relevant if you set RUN_USEAST_STACK to ‘False’ during CDK deployment\nIf you were not able to create a CloudFront distribution via CDK, you should be able to do it through console. I would advise using CloudFront as the front end to the app.\nCreate a new CloudFront distribution.\n\nIf you have used an SSL certificate in your CDK code:\n\nFor Origin:\n\nChoose the domain name associated with the certificate as the origin.\nChoose HTTPS only as the protocol.\nKeep everything else default.\n\nFor Behavior (modify default behavior):\n\nUnder Viewer protocol policy choose ‘Redirect HTTP to HTTPS’.\n\n\nIf you have not used an SSL certificate in your CDK code:\n\nFor Origin:\n\nChoose your elastic load balancer as the origin. This will fill in the elastic load balancer DNS.\nChoose HTTP only as the protocol.\nKeep everything else default.\n\nFor Behavior (modify default behavior):\n\nUnder Viewer protocol policy choose ‘HTTP and HTTPS’.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can add security features to your CloudFront distribution (recommended). If you use WAF, you will also need to change the default settings to allow for file upload to the app.\n\nIn your CloudFront distribution, under ‘Security’ -&gt; Edit -&gt; Enable security protections.\nChoose rate limiting (default is fine). Then click Create.\nIn CloudFront geographic restrictions -&gt; Countries -&gt; choose an Allow list of countries.\nClick again on Edit.\nIn AWS WAF protection enabled you should see a link titled ‘View details of your configuration’.\nGo to Rules -&gt; AWS-AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet, click Edit.\nUnder SizeRestrictions_BODY choose rule action override ‘Override to Allow’. This is needed to allow for file upload to the app.\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to Cognito -&gt; your user pool -&gt; App Clients -&gt; Login pages -&gt; Managed login configuration.\nEnsure that the callback URL is: * If not using an SSL certificate and Cognito login - https://&lt;CloudFront domain name&gt; * If using an SSL certificate, you should have three: * https://&lt;CloudFront domain name&gt; * https://&lt;CloudFront domain name&gt;/oauth2/idpresponse * https://&lt;CloudFront domain name&gt;/oauth/idpresponse\n\n\n\nNote that this only potentially helps with security if you are not using an SSL certificate with Cognito login on your application load balancer.\nGo to EC2 - Load Balancers -&gt; Your load balancer -&gt; Listeners -&gt; Your listener -&gt; Add rule.\n\nAdd Condition -&gt; Host header.\nChange Host header value to your CloudFront distribution without the https:// or http:// at the front.\nForward to redaction target group.\nTurn on group stickiness for 12 hours.\nNext.\nChoose priority 1.\n\nThen, change the default listener rule.\n\nUnder Routing action change to ‘Return fixed response’.\n\nYou should now have successfully installed the document redaction app in an AWS environment using CDK."

Check the logs, the build should complete in about 6-7 minutes.\n\n\n\nThe ‘post_cdk_build_quickstart’ file will upload a config file to S3, as the Fargate task definition references a config.env file.\nif you want to do this manually:\nCreate a config.env file to upload to the S3 bucket that has at least the following variables:\nCOGNITO_AUTH=0 # If you are using an SSL certificate with your application load balancer, you will be logging in there. Set this to 0 to turn off the default login screen.\nRUN_AWS_FUNCTIONS=1 # This will enable the app to communicate with AWS services.\nSESSION_OUTPUT_FOLDER=True # This will put outputs for each user in separate output folders.\n\nThen, go to S3 and choose the new ...-logs bucket that you created. Upload the config.env file into this bucket.\n\n\n\n\nNow that the app container is in Elastic Container Registry, you can proceed to run the app on a Fargate server. The ‘post_cdk_build_quickstart.py’ file will do this for you, but you can also try this in Console. In ECS, go to your new cluster, your new service, and select ‘Update service’.\nSelect ‘Force new deployment’, and then set ‘Desired number of tasks’ to 1."

    "text": "If the SSL certificate you are using is associated with a domain, you will need to update the DNS records for your domain registered with the AWS SSL certificate. To do this, you need to create a CNAME DNS record for your domain pointing to your load balancer DNS from a subdomain of your main domain registration, e.g., redaction.&lt;domain-name&gt;.\n\n\n\nYou will next need to a create a user in Cognito to be able to log into the app.\n\nGo to Cognito and create a user with your own email address. Generate a password.\nGo to Cognito -&gt; App clients -&gt; Login pages -&gt; View login page.\nEnter the email and temporary password details that come in the email (don’t include the last full stop!).\nChange your password on the screen that pops up. You should now be able to login to the app.\n\n\n\n\nOn the Cognito user pool page you can also enable MFA, if you are using an SSL certificate with Cognito login on the Application Load Balancer. Go to Cognito -&gt; your user pool -&gt; Sign in -&gt; Multi-factor authentication.\n\n\n\nNote: this is only relevant if you set RUN_USEAST_STACK to ‘False’ during CDK deployment\nIf you were not able to create a CloudFront distribution via CDK, you should be able to do it through console. I would advise using CloudFront as the front end to the app.\nCreate a new CloudFront distribution.\n\nIf you have used an SSL certificate in your CDK code:\n\nFor Origin:\n\nChoose the domain name associated with the certificate as the origin.\nChoose HTTPS only as the protocol.\nKeep everything else default.\n\nFor Behavior (modify default behavior):\n\nUnder Viewer protocol policy choose ‘Redirect HTTP to HTTPS’.\n\n\nIf you have not used an SSL certificate in your CDK code:\n\nFor Origin:\n\nChoose your elastic load balancer as the origin. This will fill in the elastic load balancer DNS.\nChoose HTTP only as the protocol.\nKeep everything else default.\n\nFor Behavior (modify default behavior):\n\nUnder Viewer protocol policy choose ‘HTTP and HTTPS’.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can add security features to your CloudFront distribution (recommended). If you use WAF, you will also need to change the default settings to allow for file upload to the app.\n\nIn your CloudFront distribution, under ‘Security’ -&gt; Edit -&gt; Enable security protections.\nChoose rate limiting (default is fine). Then click Create.\nIn CloudFront geographic restrictions -&gt; Countries -&gt; choose an Allow list of countries.\nClick again on Edit.\nIn AWS WAF protection enabled you should see a link titled ‘View details of your configuration’.\nGo to Rules -&gt; AWS-AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet, click Edit.\nUnder SizeRestrictions_BODY choose rule action override ‘Override to Allow’. This is needed to allow for file upload to the app.\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to Cognito -&gt; your user pool -&gt; App Clients -&gt; Login pages -&gt; Managed login configuration.\nEnsure that the callback URL is: * If not using an SSL certificate and Cognito login - https://&lt;CloudFront domain name&gt; * If using an SSL certificate, you should have three: * https://&lt;CloudFront domain name&gt; * https://&lt;CloudFront domain name&gt;/oauth2/idpresponse * https://&lt;CloudFront domain name&gt;/oauth/idpresponse\n\n\n\nNote that this only potentially helps with security if you are not using an SSL certificate with Cognito login on your application load balancer.\nGo to EC2 - Load Balancers -&gt; Your load balancer -&gt; Listeners -&gt; Your listener -&gt; Add rule.\n\nAdd Condition -&gt; Host header.\nChange Host header value to your CloudFront distribution without the https:// or http:// at the front.\nForward to redaction target group.\nTurn on group stickiness for 12 hours.\nNext.\nChoose priority 1.\n\nThen, change the default listener rule.\n\nUnder Routing action change to ‘Return fixed response’.\n\nYou should now have successfully installed the document redaction app in an AWS environment using CDK."

Please see the User Guide for a walkthrough on how to use the app.\n\n\n\nHandwriting and signatures redacted example\n\n\nTo identify text in documents, the app provides several options. ‘Local’ text/OCR image analysis uses spacy/tesseract, and works quite well for documents with typed text. If available, choose ‘AWS Textract service’ to redact more complex elements e.g. signatures or handwriting. The app then identifies personal information to redaction. The ‘Local’ is based on spaCy, is quick and gives good results if you are primarily looking for a custom list of terms to redact (see Redaction settings). If available, AWS Comprehend gives better results at a small cost.\nAfter redaction, suggested redactions can be reviewed and modified on the ‘Review redactions’ tab. The original pdf can be uploaded here alongside a ‘…redaction_file.csv’ to continue a previous redaction/review task. See the ‘Redaction settings’ tab to choose which pages to redact, the type of information to redact (e.g. people, places), or custom terms to always include/ exclude from redaction.\nNOTE: The app is not 100% accurate, and it will miss some personal information.

    "section": "General questions",
    "text": "General questions\n\nWhat is document redaction and what does this app do?\nDocument redaction is the process of removing sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII) from documents. This application is a tool that automates this process for various document types, including PDFs, images, open text, and tabular data (XLSX/CSV/Parquet). It identifies potential PII using different methods and allows users to review, modify, and export the suggested redactions.\n\n\nWhat types of documents and data can be redacted?\nThe app can handle a variety of formats. For documents, it supports PDFs and images (JPG, PNG). For tabular data, it works with XLSX, CSV, and Parquet files. Additionally, it can redact open text that is copied and pasted directly into the application interface.\n\n\nHow does the app identify text and PII for redaction?\nThe app employs several methods for text extraction and PII identification. Text can be extracted directly from selectable PDF text, using a local Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model for image-based content, or through the AWS Textract service for more complex documents, handwriting, and signatures (if available). For PII identification, it can use a local model based on the spacy package or the AWS Comprehend service for more accurate results (if available).\n\n\nCan I customise what information is redacted?\nYes, the app offers extensive customisation options. You can define terms that should never be redacted (an ‘allow list’), terms that should always be redacted (a ‘deny list’), and specify entire pages to be fully redacted using CSV files. You can also select specific types of entities to redact, such as dates, or remove default entity types that are not relevant to your needs.\n\n\nHow can I review and modify the suggested redactions?\nThe app provides a dedicated ‘Review redactions’ tab with a visual interface. You can upload the original document and the generated review file (CSV) to see the suggested redactions overlaid on the document. Here, you can move, resize, delete, and add new redaction boxes. You can also filter suggested redactions based on criteria and exclude them individually or in groups.\n\n\nCan I work with tabular data or copy and pasted text?\nYes, the app has a dedicated tab for redacting tabular data files (XLSX/CSV) and open text. For tabular data, you can upload your file and select which columns to redact. For open text, you can simply paste the text into a box. You can then choose the redaction method and the desired output format for the anonymised data.\n\n\nWhat are the options for the anonymisation format of redacted text?\nWhen redacting tabular data or open text, you have several options for how the redacted information is replaced. The default is to replace the text with ‘REDACTED’. Other options include replacing it with the entity type (e.g., ‘PERSON’), redacting completely (removing the text), replacing it with a consistent hash value, or masking it with stars (’*’).\n\n\nCan I export or import redactions to/from other software like Adobe Acrobat?\nYes, the app supports exporting and importing redaction data using the Adobe Acrobat comment file format (.xfdf). You can export suggested redactions from the app to an .xfdf file that can be opened in Adobe. Conversely, you can import an .xfdf file created in Adobe into the app to generate a review file (CSV) for further work within the application."

    "objectID": "src/faq.html#troubleshooting",
    "href": "src/faq.html#troubleshooting",
    "title": "User FAQ",
    "section": "Troubleshooting",
    "text": "Troubleshooting\n\nQ1: The app missed some personal information or redacted things it shouldn’t have. Is it broken?\nA: Not necessarily. The app is not 100% accurate and is designed as an aid. The README explicitly states: “NOTE: The app is not 100% accurate, and it will miss some personal information. It is essential that all outputs are reviewed by a human before using the final outputs.” * Solution: Always use the ‘Review redactions’ tab to manually inspect, add, remove, or modify redactions.\n\n\nQ2: I uploaded a PDF, but no text was found, or redactions are very poor using the ‘Local model - selectable text’ option.\nA: This option only works if your PDF has actual selectable text. If your PDF is an image scan (even if it looks like text), this method won’t work well. * Solution: * Try the ‘Local OCR model - PDFs without selectable text’ option. This uses Tesseract OCR to “read” the text from images. * For best results, especially with complex documents, handwriting, or signatures, use the ‘AWS Textract service - all PDF types’ if available.\n\n\nQ3: Handwriting or signatures are not being redacted properly.\nA: The ‘Local’ text/OCR methods (selectable text or Tesseract) struggle with handwriting and signatures. * Solution: * Use the ‘AWS Textract service’ for text extraction. * Ensure that on the main ‘Redact PDFs/images’ tab, under “Optional - select signature extraction” (when AWS Textract is chosen), you have enabled handwriting and/or signature detection. Note that signature detection has higher cost implications.\n\n\nQ4: The options for ‘AWS Textract service’ or ‘AWS Comprehend’ are missing or greyed out.\nA: These services are typically only available when the app is running in an AWS environment or has been specifically configured by your system admin to access these services (e.g., via API keys). * Solution: * Check if your instance of the app is supposed to have AWS services enabled. * If running outside AWS, see the “Using AWS Textract and Comprehend when not running in an AWS environment” section in the advanced guide. This involves configuring AWS access keys, which should be done with IT and data security approval.\n\n\nQ5: I re-processed the same document, and it seems to be taking a long time and potentially costing more with AWS services. Can I avoid this?\nA: Yes. If you have previously processed a document with AWS Textract or the Local OCR model, the app generates a .json output file (..._textract.json or ..._ocr_results_with_words.json). * Solution: When re-uploading your original document for redaction, also upload the corresponding .json file. The app should detect this (the “Existing Textract output file found” box may be checked), skipping the expensive text extraction step.\n\n\nQ6: My app crashed, or I reloaded the page. Are my output files lost?\nA: If you are logged in via AWS Cognito and the server hasn’t been shut down, you might be able to recover them. * Solution: Go to the ‘Redaction settings’ tab, scroll to the bottom, and look for ‘View all output files from this session’.\n\n\nQ7: My custom allow list (terms to never redact) or deny list (terms to always redact) isn’t working.\nA: There are a few common reasons: * File Format: Ensure your list is a .csv file with terms in the first column only, with no column header. * Case Sensitivity: Terms in the allow/deny list are case sensitive. * Deny List & ‘CUSTOM’ Entity: For a deny list to work, you must select the ‘CUSTOM’ entity type in ‘Redaction settings’ under ‘Entities to redact’. * Manual Additions: If you manually added terms in the app interface (under ‘Manually modify custom allow…’), ensure you pressed Enter after typing each term in its cell. * Fuzzy Search for Deny List: If you intend to use fuzzy matching for your deny list, ensure ‘CUSTOM_FUZZY’ is selected as an entity type, and you’ve configured the “maximum number of spelling mistakes allowed.”\n\n\nQ8: I’m trying to review redactions, but the PDF in the viewer looks like it’s already redacted with black boxes.\nA: You likely uploaded the ...redacted.pdf file instead of the original document. * Solution: On the ‘Review redactions’ tab, ensure you upload the original, unredacted PDF alongside the ..._review_file.csv.\n\n\nQ9: I can’t move or pan the document in the ‘Review redactions’ viewer when zoomed in.\nA: You are likely in “add redaction boxes” mode. * Solution: Scroll to the bottom of the document viewer pane and click the hand icon. This switches to “modify mode,” allowing you to pan the document by clicking and dragging, and also to move/resize existing redaction boxes.\n\n\nQ10: I accidentally clicked “Exclude all items in table from redactions” on the ‘Review redactions’ tab without filtering, and now all my redactions are gone!\nA: This can happen if you don’t apply a filter first. * Solution: Click the ‘Undo last element removal’ button immediately. This should restore the redactions. Always ensure you have clicked the blue tick icon next to the search box to apply your filter before using “Exclude all items…”.\n\n\nQ11: Redaction of my CSV or XLSX file isn’t working correctly.\nA: The app expects a specific format for tabular data. * Solution: Ensure your data file has a simple table format, with the table starting in the first cell (A1). There should be no other information or multiple tables within the sheet you intend to redact. For XLSX files, each sheet to be redacted must follow this format.\n\n\nQ12: The “Identify duplicate pages” feature isn’t finding duplicates I expect, or it’s flagging too many pages.\nA: This feature uses text similarity based on the ocr_outputs.csv files and has a default similarity threshold (e.g., 90%). * Solution: * Ensure you’ve uploaded the correct ocr_outputs.csv files for all documents you’re comparing. * Review the page_similarity_results.csv output to see the similarity scores. The 90% threshold might be too high or too low for your specific documents. The current version of the app described doesn’t seem to allow changing this threshold in the UI, so you’d mainly use the output to inform your manual review.\n\n\nQ13: I exported a review file to Adobe (.xfdf), but when I open it in Adobe Acrobat, it can’t find the PDF or shows no redactions.\nA: When Adobe Acrobat prompts you, it needs to be pointed to the exact original PDF. * Solution: Ensure you select the original, unredacted PDF file that was used to generate the ..._review_file.csv (and subsequently the .xfdf file) when Adobe Acrobat asks for the associated document.\n\n\nQ14: My AWS Textract API job (submitted via “Submit whole document to AWS Textract API…”) is taking a long time, or I don’t know if it’s finished.\nA: Large documents can take time. The document estimates about five seconds per page as a rough guide. * Solution: * After submitting, a Job ID will appear. * Periodically click the ‘Check status of Textract job and download’ button. Processing continues in the background. * Once ready, the _textract.json output will appear in the output area.\n\n\nQ15: I’m trying to redact specific terms from my deny list, but they are not being picked up, even though the ‘CUSTOM’ entity is selected.\nA: The deny list matches whole words with exact spelling by default. * Solution: * Double-check the spelling and case in your deny list. * If you expect misspellings to be caught, you need to use the ‘CUSTOM_FUZZY’ entity type and configure the “maximum number of spelling mistakes allowed” under ‘Redaction settings’. Then, upload your deny list.\n\n\nQ16: I set the “Lowest page to redact” and “Highest page to redact” in ‘Redaction settings’, but the app still seems to process or show redactions outside this range.\nA: The page range setting primarily controls which pages have redactions applied in the final ...redacted.pdf. The underlying text extraction (especially with OCR/Textract) might still process the whole document to generate the ...ocr_results.csv or ..._textract.json. When reviewing, the review_file.csv might initially contain all potential redactions found across the document. * Solution: * Ensure the ...redacted.pdf correctly reflects the page range. * When reviewing, use the page navigation and filters on the ‘Review redactions’ tab to focus on your desired page range. The final application of redactions from the review tab should also respect the range if it’s still set, but primarily it works off the review_file.csv.\n\n\nQ17: My “Full page redaction list” isn’t working. I uploaded a CSV with page numbers, but those pages aren’t blacked out.\nA: Common issues include: * File Format: Ensure your list is a .csv file with page numbers in the first column only, with no column header. Each page number should be on a new row. * Redaction Task: Simply uploading the list doesn’t automatically redact. You need to: 1. Upload the PDF you want to redact. 2. Upload the full page redaction CSV in ‘Redaction settings’. 3. It’s often best to deselect all other entity types in ‘Redaction settings’ if you only want to redact these full pages. 4. Run the ‘Redact document’ process. The output ...redacted.pdf should show the full pages redacted, and the ...review_file.csv will list these pages.\n\n\nQ18: I merged multiple ...review_file.csv files, but the output seems to have duplicate redaction boxes or some are missing.\nA: The merge feature simply combines all rows from the input review files. * Solution: * Duplicates: If the same redaction (same location, text, label) was present in multiple input files, it will appear multiple times in the merged file. You’ll need to manually remove these duplicates on the ‘Review redactions’ tab or by editing the merged ...review_file.csv in a spreadsheet editor before review. * Missing: Double-check that all intended ...review_file.csv files were correctly uploaded for the merge. Ensure the files themselves contained the expected redactions.\n\n\nQ19: I imported an .xfdf Adobe comment file, but the review_file.csv generated doesn’t accurately reflect the highlights or comments I made in Adobe Acrobat.\nA: The app converts Adobe’s comment/highlight information into its review_file format. Discrepancies can occur if: * Comment Types: The app primarily looks for highlight-style annotations that it can interpret as redaction areas. Other Adobe comment types (e.g., sticky notes without highlights, text strike-throughs not intended as redactions) might not translate. * Complexity: Very complex or unusually shaped Adobe annotations might not convert perfectly. * PDF Version: Ensure the PDF uploaded alongside the .xfdf is the exact same original, unredacted PDF that the comments were made on in Adobe. * Solution: After import, always open the generated review_file.csv (with the original PDF) on the ‘Review redactions’ tab to verify and adjust as needed.\n\n\nQ20: The Textract API job status table (under “Submit whole document to AWS Textract API…”) only shows recent jobs, or I can’t find an older Job ID I submitted.\nA: The table showing Textract job statuses might have a limit or only show jobs from the current session or within a certain timeframe (e.g., “up to seven days old” is mentioned). * Solution: * It’s good practice to note down the Job ID immediately after submission if you plan to check it much later. * If the _textract.json file was successfully created from a previous job, you can re-upload that .json file with your original PDF to bypass the API call and proceed directly to redaction or OCR conversion.\n\n\nQ21: I edited a ...review_file.csv in Excel (e.g., changed coordinates, labels, colors), but when I upload it to the ‘Review redactions’ tab, the boxes are misplaced, the wrong color, or it causes errors.\nA: The review_file.csv has specific columns and data formats (e.g., coordinates, RGB color tuples like (0,0,255)). * Solution: * Coordinates (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax): Ensure these are numeric and make sense for PDF coordinates. Drastic incorrect changes can misplace boxes. * Colors: Ensure the color column uses the (R,G,B) format, e.g., (0,0,255) for blue, not hex codes or color names, unless the app specifically handles that (the guide mentions RGB). * CSV Integrity: Ensure you save the file strictly as a CSV. Excel sometimes adds extra formatting or changes delimiters if not saved carefully. * Column Order: Do not change the order of columns in the review_file.csv. * Test Small Changes: Modify one or two rows/values first to see the effect before making bulk changes.\n\n\nQ22: The cost and time estimation feature isn’t showing up, or it’s giving unexpected results.\nA: This feature depends on admin configuration and certain conditions. * Solution: * Admin Enabled: Confirm with your system admin that the cost/time estimation feature is enabled in the app’s configuration. * AWS Services: Estimation is typically most relevant when using AWS Textract or Comprehend. If you’re only using ‘Local’ models, the estimation might be simpler or not show AWS-related costs. * Existing Output: If “Existing Textract output file found” is checked (because you uploaded a pre-existing _textract.json), the estimated cost and time should be significantly lower for the Textract part of the process.\n\n\nQ23: I’m prompted for a “cost code,” but I don’t know what to enter, or my search isn’t finding it.\nA: Cost code selection is an optional feature enabled by system admins for tracking AWS usage. * Solution: * Contact Admin/Team: If you’re unsure which cost code to use, consult your team lead or the system administrator who manages the redaction app. They should provide the correct code or guidance. * Search Tips: Try searching by project name, department, or any known identifiers for your cost center. The search might be case-sensitive or require exact phrasing.\n\n\nQ24: I selected “hash” as the anonymisation output format for my tabular data, but the output still shows “REDACTED” or something else.\nA: Ensure the selection was correctly registered before redacting. * Solution: * Double-check on the ‘Open text or Excel/csv files’ tab, under ‘Anonymisation output format,’ that “hash” (or your desired format) is indeed selected. * Try re-selecting it and then click ‘Redact text/data files’ again. * If the issue persists, it might be a bug or a specific interaction with your data type that prevents hashing. Report this to your app administrator. “Hash” should replace PII with a consistent unique ID for each unique piece of PII.\n\n\nQ25: I’m using ‘CUSTOM_FUZZY’ for my deny list. I have “Should fuzzy search match on entire phrases in deny list” checked, but it’s still matching individual words within my phrases or matching things I don’t expect.\nA: Fuzzy matching on entire phrases can be complex. The “maximum number of spelling mistakes allowed” applies to the entire phrase. * Solution: * Mistake Count: If your phrase is long and the allowed mistakes are few, it might not find matches if the errors are distributed. Conversely, too many allowed mistakes on a short phrase can lead to over-matching. Experiment with the mistake count. * Specificity: If “match on entire phrases” is unchecked, it will fuzzy match each individual word (excluding stop words) in your deny list phrases. This can be very broad. Ensure this option is set according to your needs. * Test with Simple Phrases: Try a very simple phrase with a known, small number of errors to see if the core fuzzy logic is working as you expect, then build up complexity.\n\n\nQ26: I “locked in” a new redaction box format on the ‘Review redactions’ tab (label, colour), but now I want to change it or go back to the pop-up for each new box.\nA: When a format is locked, a new icon (described as looking like a “gift tag”) appears at the bottom of the document viewer. * Solution: * Click the “gift tag” icon at the bottom of the document viewer pane. * This will allow you to change the default locked format. * To go back to the pop-up appearing for each new box, click the lock icon within that “gift tag” menu again to “unlock” it (it should turn from blue to its original state).\n\n\nQ27: I clicked “Redact document,” processing seemed to complete (e.g., progress bar finished, “complete” message shown), but no output files (...redacted.pdf, ...review_file.csv) appeared in the output area.\nA: This could be due to various reasons: * No PII Found: If absolutely no PII was detected according to your settings (entities, allow/deny lists), the app might not generate a ...redacted.pdf if there’s nothing to redact, though a review_file.csv (potentially empty) and ocr_results.csv should still ideally appear. * Error During File Generation: An unhandled error might have occurred silently during the final file creation step. * Browser/UI Issue: The UI might not have refreshed to show the files. * Permissions: In rare cases, if running locally, there might be file system permission issues preventing the app from writing outputs. * Solution: * Try refreshing the browser page (if feasible without losing input data, or after re-uploading). * Check the ‘Redaction settings’ tab for ‘View all output files from this session’ (if logged in via Cognito) – they might be listed there. * Try a very simple document with obvious PII and default settings to see if any output is generated. * Check browser developer console (F12) for any error messages.\n\n\nQ28: When reviewing, I click on a row in the ‘Search suggested redactions’ table. The page changes, but the specific redaction box isn’t highlighted, or the view doesn’t scroll to it.\nA: The highlighting feature (“should change the colour of redaction box to blue”) is an aid. * Solution: * Ensure you are on the correct page. The table click should take you there. * The highlighting might be subtle or conflict with other UI elements. Manually scan the page for the text/label mentioned in the table row. * Scrolling to the exact box isn’t explicitly guaranteed, especially on very dense pages. The main function is page navigation.\n\n\nQ29: I rotated a page in the ‘Review redactions’ document viewer, and now all subsequent pages are also rotated, or if I navigate away and back, the rotation is lost.\nA: The README states: “When you switch page, the viewer will stay in your selected orientation, so if it looks strange, just rotate the page again and hopefully it will look correct!” * Solution: * The rotation is a viewing aid for the current page session in the viewer. It does not permanently alter the original PDF. * If subsequent pages appear incorrectly rotated, use the rotation buttons again for that new page. * The rotation state might reset if you reload files or perform certain actions. Simply re-apply rotation as needed for viewing."

You can use the search bar.\nClick on the user’s username.\nOn the user details page, click the Reset password button.\nCognito will generate a new temporary password and mark the user to change it on next login.\nImportant: You will need to communicate this new temporary password to the user securely.\n\n\n\nTwo-Factor Authentication (2FA) with Apps Only\nYour application uses phone app-based 2FA. This section covers what administrators need to know.\n\nHow it Works for the User\nWhen a user logs in for the first time or when 2FA is enabled for their account, they will be prompted to set up 2FA. This typically involves:\n\nScanning a QR Code: The application will display a QR code.\nUsing an Authenticator App: The user opens their authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy, Microsoft Authenticator) and scans the QR code.\nEntering a Code: The authenticator app will generate a time-based one-time password (TOTP). The user enters this code into the application to verify the setup.\n\n\n\nAdministrator’s Role in 2FA\nAs an administrator, you generally don’t directly “set up” the user’s 2FA device in the console. The user performs this self-enrollment process within the application. However, you can manage the 2FA status of a user:\n\nEnabling/Disabling 2FA for a User:\n\nFrom your User Pool’s dashboard, click on the Users tab.\nClick on the user’s username.\nUnder the “Multi-factor authentication (MFA)” section, you’ll see the current MFA status.\nIf 2FA is not enabled, you might have the option to “Enable MFA” for the user. If your user pool requires 2FA, it might be automatically enabled upon signup.\nYou can also Disable MFA for a user if necessary. This will remove their registered 2FA device and they will no longer be prompted for a 2FA code during login until they re-enroll.\n\nRemoving a User’s 2FA Device: If a user loses their phone or needs to re-configure 2FA, you can remove their existing MFA device.\n\nOn the user’s details page, under the “Multi-factor authentication (MFA)” section, you will see a list of registered MFA devices (if any).\nSelect the device and click Remove.\nThe next time the user logs in, they will be prompted to set up 2FA again.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Useful Information for Administrators\n\nUser Status: In the “Users” tab, you’ll see the status of each user (e.g., CONFIRMED, UNCONFIRMED, FORCE_CHANGE_PASSWORD, ARCHIVED, COMPROMISED).\n\nCONFIRMED: User has confirmed their account and set their password.\nUNCONFIRMED: User has been created but hasn’t confirmed their account (e.g., through email verification) or changed their temporary password.\nFORCE_CHANGE_PASSWORD: User must change their password on next login.\n\nSearching and Filtering Users: The “Users” tab provides search and filtering options to quickly find specific users or groups of users.\nUser Attributes: You can view and sometimes edit user attributes (like email, phone number, custom attributes) on the user’s detail page.\nGroups:\n\nYou can create and manage groups under the Groups tab of your User Pool.\nGroups are useful for organising users and applying different permissions or configurations through AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles.\n\nUser Pool Settings:\n\nExplore the various settings under the User Pool Properties tab (e.g., Policies, MFA and verifications, Message customisations).\nPolicies: Define password complexity requirements.\nMFA and verifications: Configure whether MFA is optional, required, or disabled, and the types of MFA allowed (SMS, TOTP). Ensure “Authenticator apps” is enabled for your setup.\nMessage customisations: Customise the email and SMS messages sent by Cognito (e.g., for verification codes, password resets).\n\nMonitoring and Logging:\n\nIntegrate your Cognito User Pool with AWS CloudWatch to monitor user activities and potential issues.\nEnable CloudTrail logging for Cognito to track API calls and administrative actions.\n\nSecurity Best Practices:\n\nAlways use strong, unique passwords for your AWS console login.\nEnable MFA for your AWS console login.\nRegularly review user access and permissions.\nEducate users on strong password practices and the importance of 2FA.\n\n\nBy understanding these features and following best practices, administrators can effectively manage users within their AWS Cognito User Pool, ensuring secure and smooth operation of their redaction application."

    "text": "Basic Service Task Management in AWS ECS Console\nAWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) allows you to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster. This guide focuses on managing your ECS services, which maintain a desired number of tasks (container instances).\n\nAccessing Your ECS Cluster and Services\n\nLog in to the AWS Management Console.\nNavigate to ECS (Elastic Container Service) (you can use the search bar).\nIn the left navigation pane, select Clusters.\nClick on the name of the ECS cluster where your redaction app’s service is running.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Services and Tasks\nBefore we dive into management, let’s clarify key concepts:\n\nTask Definition: A blueprint for your application. It specifies the Docker image, CPU, memory, environment variables, port mappings, and other configurations for your containers.\nTask: An actual running instance of a task definition. It’s an individual container or a set of tightly coupled containers running together.\nService: A mechanism that allows you to run and maintain a specified number of identical tasks simultaneously in an ECS cluster. The service ensures that if a task fails or stops, it’s replaced. It also handles load balancing and scaling.\n\n\n\nSetting the Number of Running Tasks to 0 (Turning Everything Off)\nSetting the desired number of tasks to 0 for a service effectively “turns off” your application by stopping all its running containers.\n\nFrom your Cluster’s dashboard, click on the Services tab.\nLocate the service associated with your redaction app (e.g., redaction-app-service).\nSelect the service by checking the box next to its name.\nClick the Update button.\nOn the “Configure service” page, find the Number of tasks field.\nChange the value in this field to 0.\nScroll to the bottom and click Update service.\n\nWhat happens next:\n\nECS will begin terminating all running tasks associated with that service.\nThe “Running tasks” count for your service will gradually decrease to 0.\nYour application will become inaccessible as its containers are stopped.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n\nCost Savings: Setting tasks to 0 can save costs by stopping the consumption of compute resources (CPU, memory) for your containers.\nAssociated Resources: This action only stops the ECS tasks. It does not stop underlying EC2 instances (if using EC2 launch type), associated databases, load balancers, or other AWS resources. You’ll need to manage those separately if you want to completely shut down your environment.\nContainer Images: Your Docker images will still reside in Amazon ECR (or wherever you store them).\nDowntime: This action will cause immediate downtime for your application.\n\n\n\nTurning the Desired Number of Tasks On\nTo bring your application back online, you’ll set the desired number of tasks to your operational value (usually 1 or more).\n\nFrom your Cluster’s dashboard, click on the Services tab.\nLocate the service associated with your redaction app.\nSelect the service by checking the box next to its name.\nClick the Update button.\nOn the “Configure service” page, find the Number of tasks field.\nChange the value in this field to your desired number of running tasks (e.g., 1, 2, etc.).\nScroll to the bottom and click Update service.\n\nWhat happens next:\n\nECS will begin launching new tasks based on your service’s configuration and task definition.\nThe “Running tasks” count will increase until it reaches your desired number.\nOnce tasks are running and healthy (according to your health checks), your application should become accessible again.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n\nStartup Time: Allow some time for tasks to pull images, start containers, and pass health checks before your application is fully available.\nResource Availability: Ensure your ECS cluster has sufficient available resources (EC2 instances or Fargate capacity) to launch the desired number of tasks.\n\n\n\nForcing Redeployment\nForcing a redeployment is useful when you’ve updated your task definition (e.g., pushed a new Docker image, changed environment variables) but the service hasn’t automatically picked up the new version. It’s also useful for “restarting” a service.\n\nFrom your Cluster’s dashboard, click on the Services tab.\nLocate the service you want to redeploy.\nSelect the service by checking the box next to its name.\nClick the Update button.\nOn the “Configure service” page, scroll down to the Deployment options section.\nCheck the box next to Force new deployment.\nScroll to the bottom and click Update service.\n\nWhat happens next:\n\nECS will initiate a new deployment for your service.\nIt will launch new tasks using the latest active task definition revision associated with your service.\nExisting tasks will be drained and terminated according to your service’s deployment configuration (e.g., minimum healthy percent, maximum percent).\nThis process effectively replaces all running tasks with fresh instances.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n\nLatest Task Definition: Ensure you have activated the correct and latest task definition revision before forcing a new deployment if your intention is to deploy new code. You can update the task definition used by a service via the “Update” service flow.\nDowntime (minimal if configured correctly): If your service has a properly configured load balancer and healthy deployment settings (e.g., blue/green or rolling updates), forced redeployments should result in minimal to no downtime. ECS will bring up new tasks before shutting down old ones.\nTroubleshooting: If a deployment gets stuck or tasks fail to start, check the “Events” tab of your service for error messages. Also, check the CloudWatch logs for your tasks.\n\n\n\nOther Useful Information for Administrators\n\nService Events: On your service’s detail page, click the Events tab. This provides a chronological log of actions taken by the ECS service, such as task launches, stops, and scaling events. This is invaluable for troubleshooting.\nTasks Tab: On your service’s detail page, click the Tasks tab to see a list of all individual tasks running (or recently stopped) for that service. You can click on individual tasks to view their details, including logs, network configuration, and CPU/memory utilisation.\nLogs: For each task, you can often find a link to its CloudWatch Logs under the “Logs” section of the task details. This is critical for debugging application errors.\nMetrics: The Metrics tab on your service provides graphs for CPU utilisation, memory utilisation, and the number of running tasks, helping you monitor your service’s performance.\nDeployment Configuration: When updating a service, review the Deployment options section. This allows you to control how new deployments are rolled out (e.g., minimum healthy percent, maximum percent). Proper configuration here ensures minimal impact during updates.\nAuto Scaling (beyond basic management): For dynamic scaling based on demand, explore Service Auto Scaling. This allows ECS to automatically adjust the desired number of tasks up or down based on metrics like CPU utilisation or request count.\nTask Definitions: Before updating a service, you might need to create a new revision of your task definition if you’re deploying new code or configuration changes to your containers. You can find Task Definitions in the left navigation pane under ECS.\n\nBy mastering these basic service management operations in the AWS Console, administrators can effectively control the lifecycle of their ECS-based applications."
